    <h4>Beliefs and Opinions</h4>
  </div>
    <div class="view"> 
   <h3> The responses show a mix of beliefs and opinions on AI, specifically its role in education and creativity. Many see AI as a helpful tool for learning and improving efficiency, but there are concerns about students relying on it too much, leading to laziness and cheating. Some express worry about AI’s negative impact on artists, especially with AI-generated images and voices. Ethical concerns, like misinformation and the misuse of AI for things like deepfakes, are also raised. Overall, while AI is viewed as a key technological advancement with potential, there is a strong emphasis on using it responsibly to avoid over-dependence and harm to creativity and learning.

<h4> Attitudes on the topic  </h4>
  </div>

  <div class="view">
  
    <h3>
    The responses in regards to their attitude to AI are mixed; and ambiguous towards it. They see it as a quick and useful tool in education and other creative works, but there is also a potential concern that people or themselves can be very compliant and reliant on using AI, as well as ethical related concerns like cheating/plagiarism, using AI art to replace indie artists and mainstream artists. In conclusion, as much as how useful, quick, and quite effective AI may be, there are still flaws regarding its personal use
